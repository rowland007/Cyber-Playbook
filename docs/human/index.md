## Role-Based Access Control Matrix

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) matrices, as a security architecture concept, area way of representing access control strategies visually. They help the practitioner ensure that the access control strategy aligns with the specific access control objectives. Matrices also help show when access controls may conflict with job roles and responsibilities.

When designing an RBAC matrix there are few questions to think about and objectives to achieve.

- Ensure individuals have access to necessary information for their job role
- Maintain the Fundamental Security Design Principle of least privilege
- Who should not have permission?

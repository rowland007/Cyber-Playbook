This resource guide contains high-quality databases and frameworks. The resources below will allow you to quickly find and synthesize
information needed to detect, characterize, and counter threat actors.

- [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/)  
CIS Benchmarks, published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), are documented industry best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, and networks. Currently, there are more than 140 CIS Benchmarks in total, spanning across seven core technology categories.

- [SANS Institute Incident Handler’s Handbook](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/incident-handlers-handbook-33901)  
The SANS reading room, and specifically the Incident Handler’s Handbook, holds a wealth of knowledge
for learners looking to become practitioners. The information within the handbook will help learners
obtain skills in policy creation as well as planning on cyber incident mitigation. The handbook also
contains an important checklist on incident handling.

- [A Taxonomy of Operational Cyber Security Risks](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/TechnicalNote/2014_004_001_91026.pdf)  
The taxonomy provides a resource for the categorization of risk. This resource breaks down risk into
several categories including actions of people and internal and external issues. It also provides a
framework for how to categorize the risk based on FISMA and other government regulations.

- [ATT&CK: Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/)  
This resource is used to define and describe the steps of a cyber attack. It lists the strategies and
methods in a simple, easy-to-follow algorithm. The steps contained in the resources are not an
exhaustive list, but the majority of incidents will be covered. The major benefit of this resource is it gives
many suggestions on how to respond to cyber attacks and how to be proactive against cyber attacks.

- [NIST Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-60v1r1.pdf)  
Special publications from NIST assist in the cyber education of the country. Specifically, NIST SP 800-60
provides a structure for incident response and categories of incidents.

- [NIST Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/risk-management-framework-(RMF)-Overview)  
The risk management framework is technically NIST 800-39, but it relies heavily on two special
publications. The first is NIST 800-37, and the second is NIST 800-53. NIST 800-39 provides a framework
to handle risk management in six steps. The steps are categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize,
and monitor.

- [NIST Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/archive/2004-05-20)  
This publication is known as NIST 800-37. It provides a framework for certification and accreditation in
the federal government. This resource delivers a methodology for the government to stabilize its
accreditation evaluation.

- [NIST Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/archive/2005-06-17)  
This publication is known as NIST SP 800-53 and provides a methodology for implementation of security
controls for information systems.

- [Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)](https://www.dhs.gov/fisma)  
This is a piece of legislation that provides a basis for the federal government to oversee information
security issues. This is an essential piece of legislation that helps the government deploy needed assets
to help with cyber incidents. It also gives the government an outline for forcing businesses into reporting
cyber incidents.

- [Regular Expressions 101-102](https://regex101.com/)
The website has gone over many iterations, and started as a simple hobby project which has now grown to become one of the largest regex testing services in the world. You can view all the iterations over on the web archive.

- [What2Log](https://what2log.com/)
What2Log was a project that began when we saw a noticeable gap in computer security notation in regards to logs. There had not been a centralized resource of what and how to understand the logs of the major operating systems that are used everyday. What2Log was made to fill that exact gap.

- [nmap Cheat Sheet](https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/)

- [tcpdump Cheat Sheet](https://packetlife.net/media/library/12/tcpdump.pdf)

- [Wireshark CLI Cheat Sheet](https://cheatography.com/mbwalker/cheat-sheets/tshark-wireshark-command-line/)

- [Zeek Logs Cheat Sheet](http://gauss.ececs.uc.edu/Courses/c6055/pdf/bro_log_vars.pdf)

- [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/)
This site contains 29761 parsed manpages from sections 1 and 8 found in Ubuntu's manpage repository. A lot of heuristics were used to extract the arguments of each program, and there are errors here and there, especially in manpages that have a non-standard layout. It is written in Python and uses bashlex, a bit of NLTK (to find the interesting parts of the manpage), a little d3.js (for the connecting lines graphic) and Flask. It is served with uwsgi and nginx. 

- [Abuse IP DB](https://www.abuseipdb.com)
AbuseIPDB is a project dedicated to helping combat the spread of hackers, spammers, and abusive activity on the internet.

- [ThreatCrowd](https://www.threatcrowd.org)
ThreatCrowd is a system for finding and researching artefacts relating to cyber threats. You can view a short tutorial at [http://threatcrowd.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/investigating-threats-with-threatcrowd.html](http://threatcrowd.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/investigating-threats-with-threatcrowd.html).

Section 508 also directs the attorney general to submit reports to the president and Congress on the state of federal agencies’ compliance with the act’s requirements. In preparation for its report, the Department of Justice conducts a survey of federal agencies to obtain information on the state of compliance with Section 508 (ADA, 2018).

It also gives the government an outline for forcing businesses into reporting cyber incidents.

The latter also governs the privacy and security of health information records and transactions. HIPAA, developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, took effect in 2001 with compliance required in phases up to 2004 (PC Magazine, 2018).

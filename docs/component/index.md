![security-img](../static/images/icons_component_security.png)

The *component security* knowledge area focuses on the design, procurement, testing, analysis, and maintenance of components integrated into larger systems. The security of a system depends, in part, on the security of its components. The security of a component depends on how it is designed, fabricated, procured, tested, connected to other components, used, and maintained. This knowledge area is primarily concerned with the security aspects of the design, fabrication, procurements, testing, and analysis of components. Together with the connection security and system security knowledge areas (KAS), the component security KA addresses the security issues related to connecting components and using them with larger systems.

The *connection security* knowledge area focuses on the security of the connections between components, including both physical and logical connections. It is critical that every cybersecurity professional have basic knowledge of digital communications and networking. Connections are how components interact. Much of this material could be introduced through examples and then abstracting to the essentials and introducing the appropriate vocabulary. Together with the component security and system security knowledge areas (KAs), the connection security KA addresses the security issues related to connecting components and using them within larger systems.

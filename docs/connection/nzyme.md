### Intelligent Detection

Nzyme performs intelligent device fingerprinting and behavioral analytics to detect rogue actors. Classic signature-based detection methods are just too easy to circumvent in WiFi environments.

### Location Discovery

Build a nzyme tracker to physically locate a rogue actor using bandit definitions. First, define the characteristics of the rogue device you want to find, then send someone with a tracker to locate it.

### Threat Hunting and Forensics

By sending structured information about each recorded WiFi management frame to Graylog, you can dive into wireless threat hunting or answer questions like "who connected to this rogue access point?".

## Monitor the entire WiFi Spectrum

- The nzyme dashboard gives you a tactical overview of the entire WiFi spectrum in range. Recent threats are listed for further investigation.
- Current status and health of your nzyme sensor system is accessible in an instant.

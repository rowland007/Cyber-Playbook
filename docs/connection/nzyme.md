# Network Defense System

Monitoring network data used to be too expensive or too complex for many. We are changing that.

With nzyme, you can monitor all Ethernet and WiFi network traffic for threats, confirm expected behavior and selectively forward data to your SIEM or log management systemâ€”With minimal configuration and a small hardware footprint.

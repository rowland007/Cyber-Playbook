The *societal security* knowledge area focuses on aspects of cybersecurity that broadly impact society as a whole, for better or for worse. Cybercrime, law, ethics, policy, and privacy, and their relation to each other, are the key concepts of this knowledge area. The threat of cybercrime across global society is incredibly serious and growing. Laws, ethics, and policies are vital to the security of corporate and government secrets and assets, as well as to the protection of individual privacy and identity.

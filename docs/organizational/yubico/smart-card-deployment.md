# YubiKey Smart Card Deployment Guide

## Introduction

Yubico changes the game for strong authentication, providing superior security with unmatched ease-of-use. Our core invention, the [:octicons-link-external-16: YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/), is a small USB and NFC device supporting multiple authentication and cryptographic protocols. With a simple touch, it protects access to computers, networks, and online services for the worldâ€™s largest organizations.

## PIV and YubiKeys

The YubiKey 5 Series devices, YubiKey 4 Series devices, and the YubiKey FIPS Series devices all support the Personal Identity and Verification Card (PIV) interface specified in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), [:octicons-link-external-16: SP 800-73-4 document, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-73/4/final). Microsoft Windows supports traditional PIV smart cards for user authentication, allowing the YubiKey to be utilized as a strong authentication solution.

The YubiKey Minidriver extends the support of the YubiKey on Windows from just authentication to allowing Windows to load and directly manage certificates on it. This allows for an easy to use, easy to deploy scalable implementation of strong multi-factor authentication across an entire organization utilizing the native Windows tools and the YubiKey.

## PIV Deployment

This document covers the basic steps required to set up an Active Directory domain environment for smart card authentication, including considerations before provisioning YubiKeys for smart card login. We recommend that a qualified domain administrator be in charge of the process and that you use these instructions as a guideline for deployment. Rather than cover the complexities inherent in a corporate environment (for example, an Enterprise Root Certification Authority, multiple Subordinate Certificate Authorities, Certificate Revocation Lists, and so on), these instructions cover only the basic topics.

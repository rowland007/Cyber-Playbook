The system security knowledge area focuses on the security aspects of systems composed of components and connections, and the use of software. Understanding the security of a system requires viewing it as not only a set of components and connections but also a complete unit in and of itself. This requires a holistic view of the system. Together with the component security and connection security knowledge areas (KAs), the system security KA addresses the security issues related to connecting components and using them within larger systems.

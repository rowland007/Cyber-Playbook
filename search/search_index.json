Assets can be tangible (buildings) or intangible (reputation). A first step in risk assessment is to determine all the organization\u2019s assets and their valuethat is, the importance of each asset to the organization\u2019s ability to meet its mission. Asset value should consider the replacement value of equipment or systems. It should also include factors such as lost productivity and loss of reputation or customer confidence.</li> <li>Calculate the exposure factor (EF) - This represents the percentage of the asset value that will be lost if an incident were to occur. For example, not every car accident is a total loss. Insurance companies have actuaries who calculate the likely percentage loss for every claim. They know the cost of repairs for every make and model and can predict this value per claim. Their prediction won\u2019t be right for any single claim (except by chance), but it will be right when grouped by the hundreds or thousands.</li> <li>Calculate the single loss expectancy (SLE) - You can calculate the value of a single loss using asset value and exposure factor. If an actuary calculates that the EF of a late-model SUV is 20 percent, then every time he receives a claim, all he needs to do is look up the asset value, multiply by the EF, and he\u2019ll have a very good prediction of the payout. This allows the actuary to calculate insurance premiums accurately and reduce the risk of the insurance company losing money. (Equation: SLE = AV * EF)</li> <li>Determine how often a loss is likely to occur every year (ARO) - This is the annualized rate of occurrence, also called the risk likelihood. Some are greater than one. For example, a snowstorm in Buffalo or Berlin will happen many times per year. Others are likely to happen far less often. For example, a warehouse fire might happen once every 20 years. It is often difficult to estimate how often an incident will happen. Sometimes internal or external factors can affect that assessment. Historical data do not always predict the future. An incident such as one stemming from an internal threat is far more likely during times of employee unrest or contract negotiations than at other times.</li> <li>Determine annualized loss expectancy (ALE) - This value is the SLE (the loss when an incident happens) multiplied by the ARO. It helps an organization identify the overall impact of a risk. For infrequent events, this value will be much less than the SLE. For example, if you expect an event to occur only once every 10 years, the value will be 0.10, or 10 percent. If the SLE is $1,000, this is only \\(100 (\\)1,000 \u00d7 0.10). On the other hand, if the ARO is 20, indicating that it is likely to occur 20 times every year, the value is \\(20,000 (\\)1,000 \u00d7 20).

A network IDS (NIDS) is designed to support multiple hosts, whereas a host IDS (HIDS) is set up to detect illegal actions within the host. Most IDS programs typically use signatures of known hacker attempts to signal an alert. Others look for deviations of the normal routine as indications of an attack. Intrusion detection is very tricky. Too much analysis can add excessive overhead and also trigger false alarms. Insufficient analysis can overlook a valid attack (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Intrusion Prevention Systems - Software that prevents an attack on a network or computer system. It is a significant step beyond an intrusion detection system (IDS). Whereas an IDS passively monitors traffic by sniffing packets at a switch port, an IPS resides inline like a firewall, intercepting and forwarding packets. It is thus capable of blocking the attack in real time (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>IP Security (IPsec) - A security protocol from the IETF that provides authentication and encryption over the internet. Unlike SSL, which provides services at layer 4 and secures two applications, this works at layer 3 and secures everything in the network. Also unlike SSL, which is typically built into the web browser, this requires a client installation.

All major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Unix, Linux, etc.) support command lines that programmers and power users can employ to perform file-management operations directly and often more efficiently than by using a graphical user interface (GUI). After a user types a command, it is executed by pressing the enter key (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Configuration Management - In a network, a system for gathering current configuration information from all nodes in a LAN. In software development, a system for keeping track of large projects. Although version control, which maintains a database of revisions, is part of the system, a full-blown software configuration management system (SCM system or CM system) automatically documents all components used to build executable programs. It is able to recreate each build as well as to recreate earlier environments in order to maintain previous versions of a product. It may also be used to prevent unauthorized access to files or to alert the appropriate users when a file has been altered (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Event Logging - An action initiated by the user or the computer. For example, a user event would be any mouse movement or keystroke. An internal event detected by software could be caused by myriad things, from unexpected data in the input to a security camera sensing motion (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>File System Security - Securing software and the storage of files on a disk, SSD, or USB drive.</li> <li>Hardware Virtualization - Hardware virtualization is what most computer people are referring to when they talk about virtualization. It partitions the computer's RAM into separate and isolated virtual machines (VMs) simulating multiple computers within one physical computer. Hardware virtualization enables multiple copies of the same or different operating systems to run in the computer and prevents the OS and its applications in one VM from interfering with the OS and applications in another VM (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - Software that detects an attack on a network or computer system. A network IDS (NIDS) is designed to support multiple hosts, whereas a host IDS (HIDS) is set up to detect illegal actions within the host.

It is made up of people interacting with other people and machines that, together, set the goals and objectives, outline the strategies and tactics, and develop the plans, schedules, and necessary controls to run an organization (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Network Configuration - The configuration of infrastructure to provide the safety of the ports within a given network.</li> <li>Operating System (OS) - The computer\u2019s master control program. When a computer is turned on, a small boot program loads the OS. Although additional system modules may be loaded as needed, the main part, known as the kernel, resides in memory (RAM) at all times. The OS sets the standards for all application programs that run in the computer. Applications talk to the operating system for all user-interface and file-management operations. The OS is also called an executive or supervisor (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Patch - A modification of software. In the past, a patch used to mean changing actual executable machine instructions, but today it means replacing an executable module in its entirety, such as an .exe or .dll file. A profusion of patches to an application implies that its logic was poorly designed in the first place. Although the term typically refers to fixing a problem, a patch may also refer to a general enhancement, as the distinction between the two scenarios has become blurred. For example, a security enhancement is often a fix for a vulnerability in the program. In addition, software vendors like to announce something new in an update other than just fixing problems. Therefore, applying patches often refers to both fixes and new features (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Security Policy Management - Enforcing the policy (rules and regulations) of the organization that pertain to information and computing. Also called policy-based management, it mostly deals with database access and network resource issues: which users have access to what data and how network traffic is prioritized (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Update - To change data in a file or database or to upgrade software to a new version.<ul> <li>Update and Edit - The terms update and edit are used synonymously to indicate making changes to text, data, images, and video. Update is also used in reference to changing the source code of software.</li> <li>Update and Upgrade - The terms update and upgrade are used synonymously to refer to installing new versions of software. However, update refers to changes within the same version, while upgrade means switching to an entirely new version (upgrades are huge updates). Examples: \"I kept updating the free version, but I decided to upgrade to the premium version.\" \"Microsoft kept updating Windows 7, but I finally upgraded to Windows 8.\" (PC Magazine, 2018)</li> </ul> </li> <li>User Accounts Management <ul> <li>Access Control - The management of admission to system and network resources. It grants authenticated users access to specific resources based on company policies and the permission level assigned to the user or user group.

Virtualization turns physical RAM and storage into logical resources (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Log Aggregation - Log management is the process of handling copious volumes of logs that are made up of several processes, such as log collection, log aggregation, storage, rotation, analysis, search, and reporting. Log aggregation, therefore, is a step in the overall management process in which you consolidate different log formats coming from different sources all into one place. This makes it easier for you to analyze, search, and report on your data. (Stringfellow, 2017).</li> <li>Log File Analysis - The analysis of information generated by the computer systems.

Each stream is a subprocess that is managed by the CPU and operating system. Today\u2019s CPUs support a large number of threads. For example, IBM\u2019s POWER8 CPU comes with up to 12 cores, and each core handles eight threads for a total of 96 threads. Operating systems are written to use multithreading wherever possible; however, applications can also be written to take advantage of this parallel processing.

GUI-based versions for Windows, such as NetStat Live and X-NetStat, are also available.</li> <li>Network Access Control - An umbrella term for managing access to a network. Network access control (NAC) authenticates users logging into the network and determines what they can see and do. Network access control may also be capable of examining the health of the user\u2019s computer or mobile device (the endpoints), and it can be implemented with multiple software components or via an integrated package (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Network Address Translation - The process of mapping addresses on one network to addresses on another network.</li> <li>Network Address Translation (NAT) - The technology that maintains the privacy of the addresses of the computers in a home or business network when accessing the internet. NAT converts the private addresses that are assigned to the internal computers to one or more public addresses that are visible on the internet. It is an IETF standard that is implemented in a router or firewall as well as in any user\u2019s machine that is configured to share its internet connection. NAT assigns a number to the packet headers of the messages going out to the internet and keeps track of them via an internal table that it creates. When responses come back from the internet, NAT uses the table to perform the reverse conversion to the private IP address of the requesting client machine (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Network Analyzer - A hardware device or server software that captures packets transmitted in a network for routine inspection and problem detection.

It is also used to download files from the server either to the browser or to any other requesting application that uses HTTP (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Secure Shell (SSH) - A security protocol for logging into a remote server. It provides an encrypted session for transferring files and executing server programs. Also serving as a secure client/server connection for applications such as database access and email, it supports a variety of authentication methods. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Helsinki University researcher Tatu Yl\u00f6nen as a secure alternative to non-secure telnet, rlogin, and rsh programs for Unix servers. SSH2, a more advanced version introduced in 1998, was standardized by the IETF and is not compatible with SSH1 (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) - The standard email protocol on the internet and part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, as defined by IETF RFC 2821. It defines the message format and the message transfer agent (MTA), which stores and forwards the mail. It was originally designed for only plain text (ASCII text), but MIME and other encoding methods enable executable programs and multimedia files to be attached to and transported with the email message (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Voice Over IP (VoIP) - A digital telephone service that uses the internet for transport, as well as private IP networks. IP stands for \"internet protocol.\" In order for calls to originate and terminate from regular telephones, connections to the public telephone network (PSTN) are also provided. Telephone companies, cable companies, and dedicated providers offer this type of calling for a fixed monthly fee or low per-minute charge. Customers must have existing internet access (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Network Architectures<ul> <li>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - A middle ground between an organization's trusted internal network and an untrusted, external network such as the internet. Also called a \"perimeter network,\" it is a subnetwork (subnet) that may sit between firewalls or off one leg of a firewall. Organizations typically place their web, mail, and authentication servers in it. It is a military term that refers to the area between two enemies (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Local Area Network (LAN) - A communications network that is typically confined to a building or premises. The \"clients\" are user workstations running the Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems, while the \"servers\" hold programs and data shared by the clients. Servers come in a wide range of sizes, from PC-based servers to mainframes (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Network Address Translation (NAT) - The technology that maintains the privacy of the addresses of the computers in a home or business network when accessing the internet. It converts the private addresses that are assigned to the internal computers to one or more public addresses that are visible on the internet. It is an IETF standard that is implemented in a router or firewall as well as in any user's machine that is configured to share its internet connection.  It assigns a number to the packet headers of the messages going out to the internet and keeps track of them via an internal table that it creates. When responses come back from the internet, it uses the table to perform the reverse conversion to the private IP address of the requesting client machine (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Personal Area Network (PAN) - Transmitting data wireless over a short distance. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct are examples of this (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Protected Enclaves - Subdivision of the internal network so that it is not one large zone with no internal protections. This architectural approach to information security defense in depth can be accomplished in a number of ways, including network admissions control, firewalls, VLANs, and VPN (Northcutt, n.d.).</li> <li>Subnetwork (Subnet) - A logical division of a local area network, which is created to improve performance and provide security. To enhance performance, it limits the number of nodes that compete for available bandwidth. Instead of one network handling all the traffic, the network is divided into groups of clients and servers that interact with each other most of the time. For security, the divisions can be based on servers that have restricted applications. Routers are bridges used to traverse network segments. In an IP network, the subnet is identified by a subnet mask (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Supernetting - Combining several IP network addresses into one IP address. It reduces the number of entries in a routing table and is done in CIDR addressing as well as in internal networks.  In the following example, a group of networks with contiguous numbers starting with 172.16.8.0 and ending with 172.16.16.0 are supernetted into the subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The subnet mask is derived by comparing the binary of the first and last addresses. The last bit location on the right that is the same in both addresses marks the end of the mask. The CIDR notation for this is /19, because there are 19 1 bits in the subnet mask. For example, the IP address 172.16.8.1 would be 172.16.8.1/19 (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>VLAN - A logical subgroup within a local area network that is created via software rather than by manually moving cables in the wiring closet. It combines user stations and network devices into a single unit regardless of the physical LAN segment they are attached to and allows traffic to flow more efficiently within populations of mutual interest.  These are implemented in port-switching hubs and LAN switches and generally offer proprietary solutions. They reduce the time it takes to implement moves, adds, and changes.  VLANs function at layer 2. Since their purpose is to isolate traffic within the VLAN, in order to bridge from one VLAN to another, a router is required. The router works at the higher layer 3 network protocol, which requires that network layer segments are identified and coordinated with the VLANs. This is a complicated job, and VLANs tend to break down as networks expand and more routers are encountered. The industry is working toward \"virtual routing\" solutions, which allow the network manager to view the entire network as a single routed entity (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Wide Area Network (WAN) - A long-distance communications network that covers a wide geographic area, such as a state or country. The telephone companies and cellular carriers deploy these to service large regional areas or the entire nation. Large enterprises have their own private WANs to link remote offices, or they use the internet for connectivity. Of course, the internet is the world's largest WAN (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Network Attacks - An assault against a computer system or network as the result of deliberate, intelligent actionfor example, denial-of-service attacks, penetration, or sabotage (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Network Attack Surface<ul> <li>This presents exposure related to ports, protocols, channels, devices (from routers and firewalls to laptops and smartphones), services, network applications (SaaS) and even firmware interfaces;</li> <li>Depending on your infrastructure, you may need to include cloud servers, data, systems and processes in this (Brocklehurst, 2014).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Network Hardening / System Hardening - Making a user\u2019s computer more secure.

A path vector protocol, it was designed to supersede EGP, the original exterior gateway protocol (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) - An expansion of the IP addressing system that allows for a more efficient and appropriate allocation of addresses. The original class-based method used fixed fields for network IDs, which was wasteful. For example, Class A and B networks can address 16 million and 65 thousand hosts respectively, and most organizations given those addresses never had intentions of putting that many computers on the internet (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Domain Name System (DNS) - The internet's system for converting alphabetic names into numeric IP addresses. For example, when a web address (URL) is typed into a browser, these servers return the IP address of the web server associated with that name. In this made-up example, it converts the URL \u201cwww.company.com\u201d into the IP address 204.0.8.51. Without this, you would have to type the series of four numbers and dots into your browser to retrieve the website, which you actually can do (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - The automatic assigning of IP addresses to client machines logging into an IP network. The same address, although technically temporary, may remain with a machine indefinitely unless a conflict arises with other devices on the network. The software, which resides in the router or a server, eliminates the need to manually assign permanent \"static\" IP addresses to devices. In a home network, it is typically in the wireless router (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Dynamic IP - A temporary numeric identification assigned to a node in a TCP/IP network. When computers and devices in the network are turned on for the first time, they are assigned an IP address by a DHCP server (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Firewall - The primary method for keeping a computer secure from intruders. It allows or blocks traffic into and out of a private network or the user's computer. These are widely used to give users secure access to the internet as well as to separate a company's public web server from its internal network. They are also used to keep internal network segments secure; for example, the accounting network might be vulnerable to snooping from within the enterprise (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Gateway - A device that converts one protocol or format to another. A network gateway converts packets from one protocol to another. An application gateway converts commands and/or data from one format to another. An email gateway converts messages from one mail format to another (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Hosts - A source of information or signals. The term can refer to a computer, smartphone, tablet, or any electronic device. In a network, clients (users' machines) and servers are hosts because they are both sources of information in contrast to network devices, such as routers and switches, which only direct traffic (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>NetBIOS - The original networking protocol for DOS and Windows PCs. These packets did not contain a network address and were not easily routable between networks. As a result, the interface to NetBIOS and the transport part of NetBIOS were later separated so that NetBIOS applications could use routable protocols such as TCP/IP and SPX/IPX (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>NetFlow - A network protocol developed by Cisco for the collection and monitoring of network traffic flow data generated by NetFlow-enabled routers and switches (Rouse, 2014)</li> <li>Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) - This International Organization of Standardization model serves as a standard template for describing a network protocol stack (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Port Address Translation (PAT) Protocol - The most common way network address translation is implemented. Also called \"NAT overloading,\" \"network address port translation\" (NAPT) and \"NAT/PAT.\" It assigns a different TCP port number to each client session with a server on the internet. When responses come back from that server, the source port number becomes the destination port number and determines which user to route the packets to. It also validates that the incoming packets were indeed requested (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Port Forwarding - Also called \"port mapping,\" this is directing traffic from the outside world to the appropriate server inside a local TCP/IP network. Internet services are identified by a standard port number; for example, web traffic uses port number 80. If the local network hosts a web server that is accessible on the public internet, the port forwarding panel in the router would be configured to direct web/HTTP packets (port 80 traffic) to the IP address of the web server in the local network (LAN) (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Routing - Forwarding data to its destination (PC Magazine, 2018)</li> <li>Static IP - A permanent numeric identification assigned by the network administrator to a node in a TCP/IP network. These addresses are used for shared resources such as web servers, PBXs, and webcams (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Switching - A mechanical or electronic device that directs the flow of electrical or optical signals from one side to the other. Those with more than two ports, such as a LAN switch or PBX, are able to route traffic (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Virtual Private Network (VPN) - A private network configured within a public network such as the internet or a carrier's network. Years ago, this obsoleted private lines between company branches. Using data encryption to maintain privacy, they also allow mobile users access to the company LAN. In the past, common carriers used their vast networks to \"tunnel\" traffic between customer locations to give the appearance of a private network while sharing backbone trunks, no different than the way the internet works. Prior to the internet's IP protocol, these were built over X.25, Switched 56, frame relay, and ATM technologies (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Network Protocols<ul> <li>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) - A TCP/IP protocol used to send error and control messages. For example, a router uses this to notify the sender that its destination node is not available. A ping utility sends ICMP echo requests to verify the existence of an IP address (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Internet Protocol (IP) - The communications technology used worldwide in local networks, wide area networks, and the internet. It is the network layer in the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is used to route packets from one network to another (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - The reliable transport protocol within the TCP/IP protocol suite. It ensures that all data arrive accurately and 100% intact at the other end. It is \"connection oriented\" and requires a handshake before the session can begin (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - A TCP/IP protocol that is widely used for streaming of audio and video, voice over IP (VoIP), and videoconferencing. It is considered an unreliable delivery protocol because it does not check for errors. When transmitting voice and video, there is no time to retransmit erroneous or dropped packets. In contrast, when financial and other data are transmitted, TCP is used, which does check for errors (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Network Services<ul> <li>Network Time Protocol (NTP) - A TCP/IP protocol used to synchronize the real-time clocks in computers, network devices, and other electronic equipment that is time-sensitive. It is also used to maintain the correct time in NTP-based wall and desk clocks (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Network Switching (Ethernet)<ul> <li>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - A TCP/IP protocol used to obtain a node's physical address. A client station broadcasts this request onto the network with the IP address of the target node it wishes to communicate with, and the node with that address responds by sending back its physical address so that packets can be transmitted. This returns the layer 2 address for a layer 3 address (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Layer 2 Security Issues - In networking, the communications protocol that contains the physical address of a client or server station. It is called the \"data link layer\" or \"MAC layer\" and contains the address inspected by a bridge or switch. Layer 2 processing is faster than layer 3 processing because less analysis of the packet is required (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Reverse ARP (RARP) - A TCP/IP protocol used by a diskless workstation to obtain its IP address. Upon startup, the client station sends out this request in an Ethernet frame to the RARP server, which returns the layer 3 address for a layer 2 address (performing the opposite function of an ARP) (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Network Traffic - Computer network communications that are carried over wired or wireless networks between hosts.</li> <li>Neural Network - An artificial intelligence (AI) modeling technique loosely based on the behavior of neurons in the human brain. Unlike regular applications that are programmed to deliver precise results (e.g., \u201cif this, do that\u201d), neural networks \u201clearn\u201d how to solve a problem and improve over time. The foundation of \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cdeep learning,\u201d neural networks are used in robotics, diagnosing, forecasting, image processing, and pattern recognition (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Noise - Extraneous, unwanted signals that invade an electrical or optical system. In electronics, noise can come from strong electrical or magnetic signals in nearby lines, from poorly fitting electrical contacts, and from power line spikes. In optics, noise comes from the stray reflections of light that emanate from the various components in the optical system (PC Magazine, 2019).</li> <li>Nonfunctional Requirements - The blueprint for the design of a system that performs an action in response to some triggering event.

The word proxy means \u201cto act on behalf of another,\u201d and a proxy server acts on behalf of the user. All requests from clients to the internet go to the proxy server first. The proxy evaluates the request, and if allowed, reestablishes it on the outbound side to the internet. Likewise, responses from the internet go to the proxy server to be evaluated. The proxy then relays the message to the client.

It is used to maintain referential integrity in the database. A trigger may also execute a stored procedure (PC Magazine, 2019).</li> </ol> </li> <li>Trojan Horse - The term comes from Greek mythology, in which the Greeks battled the Trojans (people of Troy). After years of being unable to break into the fortified city, the Greeks built this, filled it with soldiers and pretended to sail away. After the Trojans brought this into the city, the Greek soldiers crept out at night and opened the gates of Troy to the returning soldiers, and Troy was destroyed (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Trojan Horse - A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms (Dukes, 2015).</li> <li>Trojan Virus - A program that appears legitimate but performs some illicit activity when run. It may be used to locate password information or make the system more vulnerable to future entry or simply destroy the user's stored software and data.

Virtualization turns \u201cphysical\u201d RAM and storage into \u201clogical\u201d resources (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Virtual Memory - Simulating more random access memory (RAM) than actually exists, allowing the computer to run larger programs and multiple programs concurrently. A common function in most every OS and hardware platform, virtual memory uses storage (hard drive or solid-state drive) to temporarily hold what was in RAM. Virtual memory allows multiple programs to load in RAM at the same time. Each application addresses RAM starting at zero, but virtual memory takes control of the RAM addressing and lets each application function as if it had unlimited RAM (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Virtual Private Network (VPN) - A private network configured within a public network, such as the internet or a carrier\u2019s network. Years ago, this obsoleted private lines between company branches. VPNs also allow mobile users access to the company LAN by using data encryption to maintain privacy. In the past, common carriers used their vast networks to \u201ctunnel\u201d traffic between customer locations to give the appearance of a private network while sharing backbone trunks, no different than the way the internet works. Prior to the internet\u2019s IP protocol, VPNs were built over X.25, Switched 56, frame relay, and ATM technologies (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Virus - Software used to infect a computer. After the code is written, it is buried within an existing program. Once that program is executed, the code is activated and attaches copies of itself to other programs in the computer and other computers in the network. Infected programs continue to propagate it, which is how it spreads (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Visual / Audio Alert - The use of alarms or warning systems to make individuals aware that the system has been compromised.</li> <li>Visualization - Using the computer to convert data into picture form. The most basic visualization is that of turning transaction data and summary information into charts and graphs.

The purpose of a this attack is significantly different from other attacks; in most traditional penetration testing exercises, a network or host is the target of attack. These attacks focus on an application itself and function on layer 7 of the OSI (Desmond, 2004).</li> <li>Web Application Security<ul> <li>Access Controls - The management of admission to system and network resources. It grants authenticated users access to specific resources based on company policies and the permission level assigned to the user or user group.

Also, verifying the identity of a user logging into a network. Passwords, digital certificates, smart cards, and biometrics can be used to prove the identity of the client to the network. Passwords and digital certificates can also be used to identify the network to the client. The latter is important in wireless networks to ensure that the desired network is being accessed (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Blind SQL Injection - A type of Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attack that asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer based on the application\u2019s response. This attack is often used when the web application is configured to show generic error messages, but the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection has not been mitigated (CGISecurity, 2018).</li> <li>Client-Side Controls - Any mechanisms or devices that allow any operations performed at the user\u2019s computer.</li> <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery - An attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which the user is currently authenticated (CGISecurity, 2018).</li> <li>Cross-Site Scripting - Causing a user's web browser to execute a malicious script. There are several ways this is done. One approach is to hide code in a \"click here\" hyperlink attached to a URL that points to a non-existent webpage. When the page is not found, the script is returned with the bogus URL, and the user's browser executes it (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Encoding System - In a digital system, a method of assigning binary codes to represent data (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Function-Specific Input Vulnerabilities - The variables or objects that are used as parameters to a function that may or may not be susceptible to exploits.</li> <li>HTTP Protocol - The communications protocol used to connect to web servers on the internet or on a local network (intranet). Its primary function is to establish a connection with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser. It is also used to download files from the server either to the browser or to any other requesting application that uses HTTP (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>JSON - JavaScript object notation (JSON) is a text-based data format that is the lightweight alternative to XML. JSON is widely used on the web for data interchange (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Recent Attack Trends - The current threat landscape and the modern exploits that are being used.</li> <li>Server-Side Controls - Any mechanisms or devices that allow any operations performed at the server (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Session Management - The overview and control of communications. The active connection between a user and a computer or between two computers (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Shared Hosting Vulnerabilities - Exploits that are common between PCs. Typically caused by some type of file sharing protocol.</li> <li>SQL Injection - An exploit that takes advantage of database query software that does not thoroughly test the query statement for correctness. Along with cross-site scripting, SQL injection is used to break into websites and extract data or embed malicious code (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Web Application Architectures - An application in which all or some parts of the software are downloaded from the web every time it runs. Following are explanations of each type:<ul> <li>Browser Based - In a browser-based web application, the user simply goes to a website, and JavaScript instructions are contained within the webpages that are retrieved. Combined with the HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) style sheet, which provide the visual layout, the browser executes the code and renders the page. In addition, processing at the server side is typically performed to access databases and other support functions. The data for a web application may be stored locally, on the web, or in both locations (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Client Based - Web applications may also run without the browser. A client program, which is either installed in the user's computer or mobile device or is downloaded each session, interacts with a server on the web using standard web protocols. This is similar to the \"client/server\" architecture that prevailed in companies before the internet exploded, except that today the server is on the internet rather than the local network. Just as in browser-based applications, the data may be stored remotely or locally (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> <li>Native Mobile Apps - Countless native iOS and Android apps use the web for additional information, such as a weather app that downloads the latest climate data or a stock app that gets the latest market quotes. Using the web's HTTP protocol, myriad mobile apps retrieve data in the background that users may or may not be aware of (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>XML - The most widely used semi-structured format for data, introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1998. XML files contain only tags and text, similar to HTML (PC Magazine, 2018).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Whitelisting - During creation of access control for computer systems, a list of items, such as IP addresses, that are explicitly allowed due to trustworthiness.</li> <li>Wiping - Overwriting media or portions of media with random or constant values to hinder the collection of data.</li> <li>Wireless Attacks - A malicious action against wireless system information or wireless networks; examples can be denial of service attacks, penetration, and sabotage (Khosrow-Pour, 2005).</li> <li>Work Breakdown Structure - A deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components (PC Magazine, 2019).</li> <li>Working Model - A prototype that demonstrates that each process in the data flow diagram can manufacture its outputs from its inputs, and each entity and relationship in the data model can supply or store the data needed by all the processes (Robertson &amp; Robertson, 2013).</li> <li>Write Blocker - A tool that prevents all computer storage media connected to a computer from being written to or modified.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"glossary/#x","title":"X","text":""},{"location":"glossary/#y","title":"Y","text":""},{"location":"glossary/#z","title":"Z","text":"<ul> <li>Zero-Day Exploits - An attack that exploits a previously unknown hardware, firmware, or software vulnerability (CNSS, 2003)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"glossary/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Astle, M.

This is the recommended method for document collaboration. The Check-Out / Check-In feature is also still available which, if used, the user must reserve it prior to editing (this will keep the integrity of the edits intact), edit it in the native application, use the Revision capability inherent in most MS Office applications to show others how the document has changed, check it in once editing is complete, and fill in the comment box after Check-in, which in effect is the automated CHANGE PAGE feature of SharePoint Online. The AF is used to emailing or downloading a document and uploading/sending it back for someone to consolidate comments. True collaboration means we all touch the exact same copy of a document, which means you can overwrite someone else\u2019s work if you aren\u2019t following basic rules.

The document will generally be created, edited, finalized and deleted from the Team site where it was produced.  Once it is initially moved to SharePoint for collaboration, all other copies on <code>C:\\</code> drive, shared drives, etc. MUST BE DELETED! It is understood that there are cases where you will need to put the document on some media other than SharePoint.  However, SharePoint is the holder of the official working copy of the document.  Any document not directly retrieved from SharePoint should be treated as other than official and not configuration controlled. The exception to this TTP is when a document becomes an official record. At that time, the official copy is located in the organization's official Records Management location and a working copy (or link to the record) may still reside in SharePoint Online.  This allows for reuse of the document without retrieval from the SharePoint Online site.

The information we generate doesn\u2019t belong to us, it belongs to the AF, the DoD, the US Government, and ultimately the US Populace. For Official Use Only (FOUO) Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is NOT enough to lock down information. It means DoD ONLY. However, this open-access philosophy also recognizes that there are laws, regulations, and policies that restrict the dissemination of certain types of information. Moreover, all SharePoint users need to understand and adhere to the dissemination restrictions. There are many types of information to which access restrictions apply and some of the classifications are Privacy Act Information, Source Selection Sensitive, Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO) (e.g., weapon system Technical Orders), Intellectual Property (Company Proprietary, Trade Secrets, etc.), and Information subject to the Foreign Disclosure and/or Export Control Laws. Every organizational site or team site front page needs to be open to all. The Site Visitors group should contain the \"Everyone but external users\" group, which is all personnel in the AFNet Active Directory. This will maximize collaboration and let people know you exist as a team or an organization.  It will also let users see who the leadership or POCs are to find out more about that organization or team. It is HIGHLY encouraged to leave the organizational branding in place on organizational site collections.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sending URLs via Email Vice Attachments \u00a0GL-02\u00a0</p> <p>Documents within an enclave accessible by all should no longer be sent via email.  URL links to the document should be sent via email instead.  If you need to send a document to an individual outside the organizational permission levels, you may use the <code>Share</code> feature. The user should ensure visitor access to the document only and not grant access to the entire list, library, site or site collection unless it is appropriate to do so.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keeping Original Format \u00a0GL-03\u00a0</p> <p>Maintain official records originated electronically (e.g., e-mail, correspondence, and presentations), in original electronic format. The metadata associated with the document is legally as important as the content.  Printing out emails loses metadata, as does saving as a text file.  Save all emails in Outlook Message Format (.msg)</p> </li> <li> <p>Versioning \u00a0GL-04\u00a0</p> <p>Versioning can be set for each document library and lists. By default, document libraries created on SharePoint Online have versioning enabled for 500 major versions. By default, lists created on SharePoint Online do not have versioning enabled.   Having versioning enabled and set to at least five (5) major versions is strongly recommended, since restores of sites in SharePoint Online from backups may not be possible. There are three choices for versioning 1) no versioning, 2) major versions only, and 3) major and minor versions.  The \"major version only\" setting means that each version is saved to the server and viewable to anyone with \"read\" or greater privileges.  The \"major and minor versions\" setting can be used in a collaborative model where you want to have some people working on a \"draft\" version, while other people can only see the \"published\" versions.  People with \"read\" privileges only see the major (a.k.a. published) versions.  People with \"contribute\" or greater privileges see (and can edit) the minor versions. Making a document a \"major\" version effectively publishes it for all persons with \"read\" or greater privileges to see. Both major and minor versions can be limited in number.  Not every document library will need both major and minor versions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provisioning and Deletions \u00a0GL-05\u00a0</p> <p>All new site collections for SharePoint Online must be requested through the New Site Request process and utilize the naming conventions referenced in <code>TTP NC-03</code>. Any user may enter a request for a new SharePoint Online site collection but all requests are approved by the point of contact (POC) for the respective organization.  Likewise, all site collection deletes (regardless of reason) must be coordinated through the Service Request process.

When choosing a name for the last portion of your URL, keep these items in mind  If migrating from the AF SharePoint On-Premise environment at the Wright-Patterson APC, we recommend keeping your numbered site (1xxxx or 2xxxx) for the name portion of the URL (e.g. <code>https//usaf.dps.mil/teams/16497</code> or <code>https//usaf.dps.mil/teams/28532</code>).- Provides a consistent name for your users.- Guarantees there will not be a name clash (someone else already using it).You may change the URL name of your new or migrating site collection if you wish. Keep it simple, but descriptive. The following rules must be observed- Can use all lowercase, an abbreviation or CamelCase in the spelling of the URL name.- Do not use spaces in the name; instead use the dash character (\u201c-\u201d) if you wish to separate words.- Do not use any other special characters in the URL name.- Do not use very common Org names in your teams site collections (FM, PK, LS, etc.) or names that could change during the scope of your project or program.- Minimum of three (3) alphanumeric characters  (e.g. <code>https//usaf.dps.mil/teams/SOS</code>)- Maximum of 20 alphanumeric characters (e.g. <code>https//usaf.dps.mil/teams/ProjABCD</code> or <code>https//usaf.dps.mil/teams/Prog-ABCDE</code>)- All named URLs are first come, first served.  Requests for names already in use will not be honored.Once the site collection has been created, the top level URL (site collection) is permanent and will not be changed.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"data/ttp/#organizational-site","title":"Organizational Site","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Using the Org Branding Template \u00a0OS-01\u00a0</p> <p>The organizational branding template should not be changed.

The 3 main groups are Owners, Members and Visitors. SharePoint Online (SPO) does not protect data. Information owners protect data. SPO only facilitates the protection of the data. Used properly, SharePoint Online Permissioning structures can easily be used to safeguard information. <code>TTP GL-01</code> (Everyone has access and shares [Broad Visibility]) takes precedence. There are many types of information to which access restrictions apply and some of the classifications are- <code>Privacy Act Information</code>- <code>Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO)</code> (e.g., weapon system Technical Orders)- <code>Intellectual Property</code> (Company Proprietary, Trade Secrets, etc.)- Information subject to the Foreign Disclosure and/or Export Control Laws- Source Selection Sensitive PII/FOUO CUI data IS allowed on SharePoint as long as it is permissioned properly and visible only to those with a need-to-know. SPO provides encryption at rest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Membership for Whole Organization \u00a0PS-02\u00a0</p> <p>The best permissions to give the organization and all its subsites is full membership to the ORG ALL active directory group.  This enhances collaboration across the organization from day one.  For instance, in <code>AFMC A6/7</code>, there are eight divisions, <code>A6X</code>, <code>A6O</code>, <code>A7A</code>, <code>A7M</code>, <code>A7R</code>, <code>A7P</code>, <code>A7O</code>, <code>A7S</code>.  We could only let AFMC <code>A7P</code> All have membership to the <code>A7P</code> org site but what if they need to have <code>A6X</code> comment on something they are working on for a spreadsheet or for a document?  It is far easier to let <code>AFMC A6/7</code> All have membership to <code>A7P</code> than to have employees scream that they can't share and that they don't want to put stuff on the <code>A6/7</code> site just to share.  This permissions structure repeats the ills of the shared drive - something we need to avoid in a collaborative environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Documenting Need to Know \u00a0PS-03\u00a0</p> <p>To safeguard controlled unclassified information (CUI), restrict it at site or list/library level.  Avoid restricting at the folder level. Never restrict at a document/item level. Sites should only be restricted if entire site content is sensitive (source selection team, personnel management). Best application for unique permissions is at list/library level.

If these things are not needed, a library is probably the best bet. Keep in mind, subsites should be created laterally/horizontally across the site collection in order to maintain the site structure, prevent excessive deepening of site hierarchy, and to keep URLs short.

Meeting the challenge, especially in higher education, requires strategic thinking, and that strategy must come from cybersecurity-specific strategic thinking.</p> Credit: Walter Vasconcelos \u00a9 2019 <p>Cybersecurity leaders in higher education spend only a small percentage of their time developing strategy, but this activity is likely to have the largest impact on their institutions. Having a strategy that evolves to adapt to a changing environment can make a good security team into a great one. A well-thought-out strategy empowers the institution to act in alignment with itself, efficiently moving toward common goals.</p> <p>Most of us don't know how to create an effective cybersecurity strategy. I certainly didn't. After many years of trying to fit cybersecurity strategy (square peg) into either an IT strategy or a business strategy approach (round holes), I realized that cybersecurity differs enough from both IT strategy and business strategy that the traditional approach won't work.</p> <p>When I talk with people from private industry, they are always astonished at the cybersecurity challenges that we face in higher education. Generally, they don't realize that we face nation-state actors and that colleges and universities are essentially small cities with almost every kind of critical and sensitive data there is. Mixing in higher education's core values of autonomy, privacy, and experimentation presents significant challenges in cybersecurity.</p> <p>The first step in facing these challenges is developing and executing a workable strategy. Many approaches that people call strategies really are not. These include \"risk-based security programs\" or even \"risk-based strategies.\" Risk is just one component of a strategy. Focusing only on risk leads to tactical decisions. Other components include increased regulation and compliance standards. Meeting regulatory and compliance requirements should be a strategic goal, but again, this should not be the strategy itself.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#strategy-definitions","title":"Strategy Definitions","text":"<p>To get the most value from a strategy, we need to have the correct definition. Strategy started as a military term in the eighteenth century but has been in use as a concept since organized warfare began. Generally, strategy involves allocating a nation-state's resources toward winning a war as opposed to winning a battle. In the late twentieth century, business began to adopt the term. Even though the environments are vastly different (of course), the concept does translate well to the business environment.</p> <p>Below are three common definitions of strategy from a business perspective. Though all three are valid, they all are also incomplete. Therefore, I'll combine them into a single definition that best fits cybersecurity. First, the most-recent Wikipedia definition of strategy is: \"A high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty.\"<sup>1</sup> This is a good start. Cybersecurity is the poster child for conditions of uncertainty. However, we need more from a strategy. Second, Henry Mintzberg calls strategy \"a pattern in a stream of decisions.\"<sup>2</sup> This definition captures the concept that a strategy should drive alignment throughout an organization\u2014a concept that is foundational to success, in my experience. Third, Business Dictionary defines strategy as \"planning and marshalling resources for their most efficient and effective use.\"<sup>3</sup> This idea of allocation or prioritization of resources is a critical component. Thus, I combine all three of these and define strategy as follows: \"A long-term plan that allocates resources and sets a framework for decision-making to achieve long-term goals under conditions of uncertainty.\"</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#business-strategy","title":"Business Strategy","text":"<p>Business strategies are slightly more straightforward than higher education strategies because almost every activity that a business performs can be traced back to dollars. An activity is either a cost or a revenue, and businesses aim to maximize profits. Colleges and universities are different. They must have more revenue than expenses, but in higher education, surplus dollars do not necessarily mean that an institution is performing better. The definition of success is stakeholder value, making the success of a college or university much more difficult to track.</p> <p>Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema talk about three types of business strategy: customer intimacy; product leadership; and operational excellence.<sup>4</sup> Each offers a framework that is consistent with the definition of strategy stated above. Businesses executing a customer intimacy strategy focus their resources on the customer experience. Nordstrom was famous for this approach; a resurgence of this line of thought is evident in retail today. To compete with online shopping, many retail companies are focusing on a customer experience that online sellers can't provide. Second, businesses that execute a product leadership strategy are providing a product or service that is better for some segment of the market than that of any competitor. Apple under Steve Jobs is an example. Apple invested a great deal into R&amp;D, and accounts of Jobs's attention to detail and the focus of the Apple design teams illustrate the company's slavish devotion to this strategy. As a result, those who believe the iPhone is the best smartphone will pay a premium. Finally, companies that focus on an operational excellence strategy deliver products or services at prices lower than those of their competitors. Walmart is a classic example.</p> <p>If you squint your eyes, you might be able to see how a cybersecurity strategy could be devised to fit one of these patterns. But doing so would not be intuitive.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#it-strategy","title":"IT Strategy","text":"<p>The Wikipedia definition of technology (IT) strategy is: \"the overall plan which consists of objectives, principles and tactics relating to the use of technologies within a particular organization.\" TechTarget states that IT strategy is a \"comprehensive plan that outlines how technology should be used to meet IT and business goals.\"<sup>5</sup> The main concept to note is that IT strategy is not adversarial or competitive per se. In business strategy, by contrast, companies are striving to succeed over competitors. IT strategy must support the company strategies and deliver what the company needs.</p> <p>Many IT strategies are simply tactical checklists of best practices. This represents an operational efficiency approach. IT strategies generally involve the prioritization of resources both within the organization and within the IT department. The long-term goals usually fall into two categories: those that enable a business goal, and those that free resources for business efforts. For example, a retail business may have a customer intimacy strategy. To execute this strategy, it may choose to collect and analyze data. The company may decide to increase the investment in information technology in order to increase the delivery and quality of information as a business goal. An example of a strategy to free resources would be IT consolidation that might trade a decrease in responsiveness for resources that can be spent elsewhere.</p> <p>Risk must be part of the IT strategy. Risks include obvious ones such as disaster recovery and business continuity. Risk management involves determining how much risk the business can tolerate versus the costs required to address those risks. Availability is also a central tenant of cybersecurity. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks are the core of cybersecurity, so this is the obvious place where the IT strategy and the cybersecurity strategy overlap and must be aligned. However, making the cybersecurity strategy part of the IT strategy is a mistake. The two functions are too different to be fully integrated.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#strategic-analysis","title":"Strategic Analysis","text":"<p>Strategic analysis in business is usually organized into strengths, weaknesses, opportunity, and threats\u2014aka SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis will work for cybersecurity, but it feels forced to me. There are three characteristics of cybersecurity that suggest a different approach. First, cybersecurity will always be a function of the organization's strategy. Second, cybersecurity is reactive and not proactive. Finally, cybersecurity is asymmetrical.</p> <p>Cybersecurity will always be a function of the organization's strategy. The purpose of cybersecurity is to protect the information assets of the organization. An organization owns information assets so that it can accomplish its mission and give it an advantage over its competitors. According to Bill Stewart and his co-authors, two questions are the key to developing a strategy: (1) \"How does cybersecurity enable the business?\" and (2) \"How does cyber risk affect the business?\"<sup>6</sup> Like IT strategy, a standalone cybersecurity strategy would not make sense. The accusation \"security for security's sake\" would ring true. A cybersecurity strategy must complement the overall strategy as well as the IT strategy.</p> <p>Cybersecurity is reactive and not proactive. Many experts have encouraged us to think proactively about cybersecurity and have called their strategic approaches proactive. Maybe it's semantics, but for me there is a difference between acting proactively in a tactical sense and having a proactive strategy. We can't seek out bad guys and arrest them or destroy their capability before they attack us. To me, a proactive strategy means acting before our adversaries do\u2014either to beat them to a goal or to degrade their ability to obtain their goals. We can prepare for attacks before they happen, but we can't act until they occur. Our adversaries still pick the time, the place, and the method of attack.</p> <p>Cybersecurity is asymmetrical. This is because our adversaries have options that we do not. We must operate within a legal framework that limits what we can do. Our goal is to defend our information. Our adversaries' goals are to steal or change our information or to stop us from having access to it. An analogy is a guerrilla war where the conventional forces are trying to defend territory and population while the guerrilla force is trying to gain political advantage by attacking the conventional force and civilian infrastructure.</p> <p>Rather than considering SWOT, cybersecurity strategic analysis should look at threats and constraints. Essentially, the purpose of a cybersecurity program is to mitigate the threats it faces while operating within its constraints.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#threats","title":"Threats","text":"<p>Whereas others might use the term risks, I'll use the term threats. This implies that there is a thinking and reactive adversary on the other side. We are looking at adversaries and what they might try to do to our college or university. We must know what it is that adversaries want to attack. What is valuable to them? How valuable is that information to them, and how much effort is required? The answers to those questions determine the likelihood that an attacker will go after that information. We must also look at the impact of a successful attack on our institution. If our adversaries succeed, what will be the impact?</p> <p>Threat = Impact X (Value / Effort). This formula is actually a qualitative analysis. Of course, we all would love to have data that could be used to quantify risk. However, when we rely too much on metrics to calculate risk in cybersecurity, we get precision but not accuracy. We get numbers that we can measure, calculate, and compare, but these numbers might lead us to the wrong conclusions. Take the number of compromises, for example. If the number of compromises per month is dropping by 5 percent, does this mean that our security is getting better? Or does it instead mean that our adversaries have adapted, and we aren't detecting compromises? Or does it mean that our adversaries have moved to different activities but will be back in the future? Also, the data that we gather is usually based on assumptions. Too many events in cybersecurity are \"black swans\"\u2014unpredicted by previous events. Metrics can be useful and helpful, but they must be incorporated into reasoned qualitative judgment. Table 1 shows another way to view this formula/analysis.</p> <p>Table 1. Threat Analysis</p> Threat Category Threat Description Impact Value to Attacker Effort High Student Health Services database breach Office of Civil Rights fines and increased oversight; identity theft; health insurance fraud; lawsuits (High) $80 per record on black market x 40,000 students = $3.2 million High Moderate Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on single sign-on system Unable to conduct business (High) Ransom payment; publicity Low Low Stolen credentials used to access paid research database Possible lawsuit from research database provider (Low) $10,000 and up Low <p>To better illuminate the difference between the value to the attacker and the impact on the institution, look at credit cards. Attackers can make good money from stolen credit cards whether they sell the cards or use the cards themselves. Stealing credit cards is worth a lot of effort. But individuals are liable for only up to $50 if their credit card number is stolen. Likewise, a college or university storing credit card data that is stolen has no impact from the theft. The credit card providers are the ones who lose. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) uses fines, the threat of increased process, or the revoking of card-processing privileges to create an impact on the institution, pushing colleges and universities to expend the effort necessary to protect the cards.</p> <p>A good cybersecurity strategy focuses on identifying the largest (high-impact) threats in order to garner the resources to protect the institution and defend against those threats.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#constraints","title":"Constraints","text":"<p>We all know what we'd do in a perfect world, with unlimited funding, complete cooperation, and as many talented staff as we need. Since we don't live in a perfect world, the cybersecurity strategy must focus on those threats that have been identified to be the most serious (as noted above) while considering the numerous constraints limiting cybersecurity programs in higher education.</p> <ul> <li>Funding. This constraint is fairly straightforward. It concerns capital, operating expenses, and the amount and timing of money that can be spent.</li> <li>Regulations and Laws. The cybersecurity program must be compliant with regulations and laws. Resources expended for compliance are not available for other purposes.</li> <li>Staff Time and Talent. The capacity/capability of current staff and the ability to hire and retain talent are both limited. High turnover due to IT markets, the pay that can be offered, and the capacity of staff to learn new skills are all examples of restrictions around staff time and talent.</li> <li>Business Overhead. The individual culture of various groups in a college or university will determine how much can be accomplished through security controls. For example, understanding that the finance team will tolerate a lot of overhead whereas clinical physicians will tolerate very little is important. The process of assigning high-, medium-, or low-tolerance ratings for the various groups can provide better insight into an organization's overall tolerance for security overhead.</li> <li>Political Capital. This constraint overlaps a bit with business overhead, but the emphasis here is on leadership and peer support. For example, if a college or university recently suffered a major security breach, the security team may have a good deal of political capital with senior leadership. In addition, knowing how much those in the rest of the institution trust the security team\u2014that is, the level of peer support\u2014is critical. I recommend making a list of the key leaders across the institution and categorizing them as \"will support with a solid case,\" \"can win support,\" or \"tough sell.\" Understanding political capital allows it to be spent in the most valuable ways and prevents the development of a cybersecurity strategy that won't be supported.</li> <li>Accountability. This could be a subcategory of political capital, but I feel it deserves its own discussion in higher education. Being aware of the culture of accountability in an institution is critical to developing a successful cybersecurity strategy. If a strategy depends on shadow IT, but shadow IT is never disciplined for ignoring a central edict, the strategy is in trouble. Are there any real consequences to ignoring cybersecurity? The answer to that question will affect the cybersecurity strategy.</li> <li>Calendar Time. This constraint includes the dates that capabilities must be in place and the resources that are available. Not everything in the cybersecurity strategy will be time-critical. This constraint is best analyzed in two parts: (1) identifying any and all limitations on time; (2) sequencing decisions to include calendar time considerations.</li> <li>Governance. If governance is imposed on cybersecurity, then it is a constraint. If governance can be created by the chief information security officer, then it is a component of the cybersecurity strategy. With a trusted security team, governance could be as lightweight as a reporting line. Most security teams in higher education don't have that luxury, however. In this case, advisory committees, with their transparency and participation, are great ways to build trust and support. Heavier governance can involve an oversight committee, with many subcommittees and an executive committee. In a lower-trust environment, the oversight committee will make decisions and approve major projects. Heavy governance will be slower, more time-consuming, and more restrictive. On the other hand, the security team will have more support and will be able to impose more overhead, and the rest of the institution will be more accountable.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#strategic-patterns-and-the-cybersecurity-strategic-matrix","title":"Strategic Patterns and the Cybersecurity Strategic Matrix","text":"<p>I'm using the term strategic patterns in the same way that software engineering uses the term design patterns. Software design patterns themselves can't be used to create an application; instead they serve as a component of the application design. Likewise, strategic patterns function as one part of the overall cybersecurity strategy.</p> <p>Probably the most common cybersecurity strategic pattern used today is the \"kill chain.\"<sup>7</sup> Another is \"Defense in Depth,\" which first came into favor in the 1990s.<sup>8</sup> People-centric patterns were more popular a decade ago but are still important. Process-centric patterns are common and may be appropriate depending on the maturity of a cybersecurity program. Technology alone is unlikely to solve all our problems, but understanding what we need technology to do and its relationship with resources is a critical part of any cybersecurity strategy.</p> <p>Much like fitting together the appropriate software design patterns to create an application design, fitting together the right strategic patterns can help create a cybersecurity strategy. A collection of cybersecurity strategic patterns forms the high-level strategy. Moving down a layer will involve people, process, and technology. A matrix is the natural way to capture this level of the strategic plan. Should people be emphasized over process? Which technology will be chosen? A cybersecurity strategic matrix can capture as well as analyze these decisions.</p> <p>Table 2 shows a matrix with the five high-level cybersecurity strategic functions from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework\u2014identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover\u2014on the left side and with people, process, and technology across the top. This visual representation shows how the five functions are being addressed and the trade-offs that are being made. The five top-level functions could also be subdivided into more areas. For example, protect could be detailed as access control, awareness and training, data security, information protection processes, maintenance, and protective technology.</p> <p>Table 2. Cybersecurity Strategy Coverage and Trade-Off Matrix</p> People Process Technology Identify Protect Detect Respond Recover <p>Based on the cybersecurity strategic patterns chosen, projects or initiatives can be inserted into the cells. These projects or initiatives represent the resources that are required. Doing this will necessarily prioritize the functions and how they will be addressed. For example, if the Kill Chain pattern is used, then the detect function(s) will probably be a top priority. A Defense-in-Depth pattern will require more effort in the protect function(s).</p> <p>Next, efforts should be prioritized among People, Process, and Technology. For example, a startup that has a small, dedicated staff, that doesn't have much money, and that must be highly productive will look first at solving issues with people. By contrast, organizations that are very mature can look to process first for success. Here is another example. The Identify function includes asset management, which requires inventorying hardware, software, external systems, and data flows. These needs can be addressed by people, process, or technology but most likely by a combination of all three. People can provide inventory information. Process can issue an \"authority to operate\" and require documentation. Technology tools can perform automatic discovery of hardware and software. There are trade-offs in each of these approaches.</p> <p>Each of the cells in the cybersecurity strategic matrix can also include submatrices. For example, the Detect/Technology cell could hold a matrix detailing Network, Payload, and Endpoint detection functions across Real-Time/Near-Real-Time and Post-Compromise technologies. Or the Protect/People cell could include a matrix dividing People into Users, IT Staff, and Security, with Mandatory and Optional functions. The idea is to make clear the tradeoffs involved in the allocation of resources.</p> <p>Another way the cybersecurity strategic matrix can be helpful is in understanding emergent priorities and patterns. As tradeoffs are made in order to allocate resources within constraints, it may become obvious that the initial thoughts and plans simply aren't practical. A better way to abstract resource allocation, or a different strategic pattern, may become clear. These insights will be important in communicating the cybersecurity strategy.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#communicating-the-cybersecurity-strategy","title":"Communicating the Cybersecurity Strategy","text":"<p>The implementation of a successful cybersecurity strategy depends on a wide variety of stakeholders. For the strategy to be useful to others across the college or university, they must act in alignment with it. Yet communicating the cybersecurity strategy throughout an institution can be challenging. People in different roles need different levels of understanding. End-users will be the least sophisticated security-wise, whereas the security team must of course understand the details. In between are the system administrators, developers, academic leaders, and more. The cybersecurity strategy must be communicated in multiple ways tailored for everyone in the institutional audience.</p> <p>Creating a cybersecurity strategy that serves as a framework for decision-making requires a concept simple enough that people can hold it in their head. What does this mean in practice? The strategy description must fit easily on one PowerPoint slide. There are two effective ways to do this. Both methods can be incorporated into a two- to five-minute presentation that will create a memory aide for the audience.</p> <p>One way is to use the old standby of bullet lists, phrasing the text so that it captures the essence of the strategy. The range should be three to seven bullets, with five being optimal. A word or two followed by a phrase or sentence gives the viewer something to hold on to. For example: \"Information Centric: Categorize and prioritize defending high-risk information.\" It should be possible to explain the strategy in five minutes\u2014not quite an elevator pitch, but not much more.</p> <p>The other, perhaps better method is to use a diagram. The combination of a graphic and words is easier for someone to remember than just text. This might be hard if you're not an artistic person, but communication teams may be able to help. The risk is greater if the diagram doesn't hit the mark, but the possibility of a winning home run is greater as well.<sup>9</sup> Figure 1 is the illustration I use to communicate Penn State's cybersecurity strategy.</p> Figure 1. A Sample Illustration of Cybersecurity Strategy <p>These basic explanations might be the most important part of a cybersecurity strategy. Unfortunately, they are, like a poem, the hardest to get right. As the saying goes, a poor plan well-executed beats a great plan poorly executed. This simple, high-level explanation of the cybersecurity strategy will play a large part in determining how others across the institution do (or don't) align.</p> <p>Still, for those who want additional details and who have the tolerance to read or listen to more, further explanations are required. A \"one-pager\" is an option. This is a document that explains the strategy on one side (or both sides) of a piece of paper. Another option is a fifteen- to thirty-minute strategy briefing. This could consist of seven to fifteen slides that put more flesh on the bones of the strategy. The higher the picture-to-bullet ratio, the more effective this communication will be. I also suggest including a discussion of the threats and constraints. The more comfortable people are with the reasoning behind the strategy, the more enthusiastic they will be in implementing it.</p> <p>Depending on the institution, a well-polished explanation of the cybersecurity strategy may not be required. The main benefit comes from the writing. Chances are that the detailed justifications will be helpful, at some point, for various initiatives.</p> <p>I believe that effective communication is perhaps the most critical aspect in the entire process of creating a cybersecurity strategy. Feedback is thus essential. Words and concepts that make perfect sense to the security team, for instance, may be lost on some stakeholders or, worse, may evoke a bad reaction. Communication will need to be modified over time.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Thinking about cybersecurity from solely a risk-based perspective or as the risk part of an IT strategy will not result in the most efficient allocation of resources, nor will doing so align the institutional cybersecurity efforts. Cybersecurity demands a strategic approach because it is difficult, rapidly changing, and potentially devastating to a college or university. Cybersecurity differs from either IT or business operations because it is adversarial, reactive, and asymmetrical. Cybersecurity efforts must be closely aligned to the institution's overall strategy and must complement its IT strategy. Failure to think and act strategically results in the inefficient use of resources and increases institutional risk.</p> <p>The inputs to cybersecurity strategy are threats and constraints. The strategy must identify the institution's information assets and the impact of a successful attack on them. Understanding the value to attackers provides insight into the likelihood of attacks and how much effort adversaries will expend to gain those assets. This analysis provides a risk-based prioritization for defending information. Institutions have limited resources to expend on cybersecurity. These resources include not only funding and staff but also intangibles like political capital and accountability. An effective strategy must address the most serious threats while staying within the constraints of the institution.</p> <p>Cybersecurity strategy must be long-term, be effective under uncertainty, prioritize resources, and provide a framework for alignment throughout the institution. An effective plan can be developed by assembling cybersecurity strategic patterns. In addition, a matrix that matches the functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to people, process, and technology can provide a visual representation of the implementation of the cybersecurity strategy. Finally, sequencing the contents of this matrix can create a roadmap of projects, initiatives, and efforts to execute the strategy. Beyond offering a risk-based approach, the strategy will effectively allocate resources and align efforts.</p> <p>Cybersecurity is not just an IT function; it is an institutional function. Thus, almost all members of the college/university community have a part to play and should act in alignment with the cybersecurity strategy. And since they can't align with the strategy unless they understand and remember it, communicating the strategy is as important as devising the strategy itself.</p> <p>Cyberattacks on colleges and universities are increasingly frequent and damaging. The cyberthreat to higher education overall is both significant and likely to grow for the foreseeable future. Meeting the challenge, especially in higher education, requires strategic thinking, and that strategy must come from cybersecurity-specific strategic thinking.</p> Cite <p> Creating a Cybersecurity Strategy for Higher Education by  Don Welch is licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</p>"},{"location":"organizational/cybersecurity-strategy/#footnotes","title":"Footnotes","text":"<ol> <li> <p> \"Strategy,\" Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, accessed March 29, 2019.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Henry Mintzberg, \"Strategies in Pattern Formation,\" Management Science 24, no. 9 (May 1978).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Strategy\" [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/strategy.html], Business Dictionary, accessed March 29, 2019.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema,  \"Customer Intimacy and Other Value Disciplines,\" Harvard Business Review (January-February 1993).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p> \"Technology Strategy,\" Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, accessed March 29, 2019;  \"IT Strategy (Information Technology Strategy),\" TechTarget, last updated November 2017.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Bill Stewart, Sedar LaBarre, Matt Doan, and Denis Cosgrove, \"Developing a Cybersecurity Strategy: Thrive in an Evolving Threat Environment,\" in Matt Rosenquist, ed.,  Navigating the Digital Age: The Definitive Cybersecurity Guide for Directors and Officers (Chicago: Caxton Business &amp; Legal, 2015), p. 172.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>See Eric M.

Our strongest recommendation is to ensure that all dates are converted to UTC time (00:00) and in ISO 8601 date format. An example of this format is the following date and time: <code>2021-09-26T18:54:07.350Z</code>. This same date format and consistency in time zone ensures that when we sort the timeline, the data is sorted chronologically. If there is a mess of date formats from different time zones to take into account, we will have a hard time understanding the threat actor\u2019s path through the network. If UTC time zone and ISO 8601 time format are always used in the timeline, then life will be a little bit easier. When running a complex investigation, having something that is easier matters, and frankly, when it comes to incidents, being accurate and efficient is paramount.</p>"},{"location":"organizational/incident-response/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>With this consolidated and organized information, we can focus on helping the organization identify the impact to business assets, and in conjunction with legal counsel, identify any regulatory reporting requirements. The CrowdStrike IR Tracker also helps ensure that the root cause of the incident gets identified, so your organization can remediate the vulnerabilities that were exploited and led to the incident. </p> <p>To make the incident easier to understand for business, we often create attack diagrams or graphical timelines from the consolidated Timeline tab. CrowdStrike often creates these diagrams to succinctly explain incidents for clients that have experienced extensive data breaches of hundreds of systems or over multiple years. </p> <p>Finally, it is recommended to use an online collaboration spreadsheet technology such as Office 365 or Google Sheets. Using collaboration tools provides an efficient means for different people to update an online document concurrently and minimizes the risk of versioning issues. Data is also updated in near real time, which helps teams communicate effectively. Some of the repetitive copy and paste tasks can be automated with the scripting features provided by the collaboration technology, but we will leave that for a follow-up blog, and we are happy to hear your ideas on how to minimize the effort on keeping the tracker up to date.</p> <p>The CrowdStrike IR Tracker itself is not a panacea to cure all ills of the IR process, but rather a tool that, if used correctly, can greatly increase efficiency of collaboration between individuals and teams. Like all tools, it must be used correctly, and one of the key tenets of the CrowdStrike IR teams is our \u201ctracker hygiene.\u201d We know that if the CrowdStrike IR Tracker is not maintained then the results are going to be poor. The tracker gives back, but it can only give back from the effort that is put into it by ALL team members, ALL of the time. Maintaining the tracker for the incident takes work and discipline, but it is our belief that it is very much worth the effort.</p> <p>CrowdStrike is sharing the CrowdStrike Incident Response Tracker Template  to give the DFIR community a starting point for collecting and recording incident artifacts in a consolidated and organized fashion. It is our hope that this resource is a useful baseline for building upon within your own organization, or when an IR tracker is needed on short notice.</p> Link to Source <p> CrowdStrike Blog by Paul Pratley Mark Goudie</p>"},{"location":"organizational/policy-implementation/","title":"Policies, Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures","text":"Image Citation <p> Model of Public PolicyModel of Public Policy by  (de Sousa &amp; Capdevila, 2021) &amp; \u00a9 State of New South Wales  is licensed under  CC BY 4.0</p>"},{"location":"organizational/policy-implementation/#policy","title":"Policy","text":"<p>Policy is one of those terms that can mean several things. For example, there are security policies on firewalls, which refer to the access control and routing list information. Standards, procedures, and guidelines are also referred to as policies in the larger sense of a global information security policy.</p> <p>A good, well-written policy is more than an exercise created on white paper\u2014it is an essential and fundamental element of sound security practice. A policy, for example, can literally be a lifesaver during a disaster, or it might be a requirement of a governmental or regulatory function. A policy can also provide protection from liability due to an employee's actions, or it can control access to trade secrets.</p> <p>NIST categorizes computer system security policies into three basic types:</p> <ul> <li>Program policy used to create an organization's computer security program</li> <li>Issue-specific policies used to address specific issues of concern to the organization</li> <li>System-specific policies technical directives taken by management to protect a particular system</li> </ul> <p>Program policies and issue-specific policies both address policy from a broad level, usually encompassing the entire organization. Program policy is traditionally more general and strategic; for example, the organization's overall computer security program may be defined in a program policy. An issue-specific policy is a nontechnical policy addressing a single or specific issue of concern to the organization, such as the procedural guidelines for checking disks brought to work or e-mail privacy concerns. Issue-specific policies are similar to program policies in that they are not technically focused.</p> <p>However, program policy and issue-specific policies do not provide sufficient information or direction, for example, how to establish an access control list or train users on what actions are permitted.

Ranum \u00a92005</p> <p>There's lots of innovation going on in security - we're inundated with a steady stream of new stuff and it all sounds like it works just great. Every couple of months I'm invited to a new computer security conference, or I'm asked to write a foreword for a new computer security book. And, thanks to the fact that it's a topic of public concern and a \"safe issue\" for politicians, we can expect a flood of computer security-related legislation from lawmakers. So: computer security is definitely still a \"hot topic.\" But why are we spending all this time and money and still having problems?</p> <p>Let me introduce you to the six dumbest ideas in computer security. What are they? They're the anti-good ideas. They're the braindamage that makes your $100,000 ASIC-based turbo-stateful packet-mulching firewall transparent to hackers. Where do anti-good ideas come from? They come from misguided attempts to do the impossible - which is another way of saying \"trying to ignore reality.\" Frequently those misguided attempts are sincere efforts by well-meaning people or companies who just don't fully understand the situation, but other times it's just a bunch of savvy entrepreneurs with a well-marketed piece of junk they're selling to make a fast buck. In either case, these dumb ideas are the fundamental reason(s) why all that money you spend on information security is going to be wasted, unless you somehow manage to avoid them.</p> <p>For your convenience, I've listed the dumb ideas in descending order from the most-frequently-seen. If you can avoid falling into the the trap of the first three, you're among the few true computer security elite.</p>"},{"location":"societal/six-dumb-ideas/#default-permit","title":"Default Permit","text":"<p>This dumb idea crops up in a lot of different forms; it's incredibly persistent and difficult to eradicate. Why? Because it's so attractive. Systems based on \"Default Permit\" are the computer security equivalent of empty calories: tasty, yet fattening.</p> <p>The most recognizable form in which the \"Default Permit\" dumb idea manifests itself is in firewall rules. Back in the very early days of computer security, network managers would set up an internet connection and decide to secure it by turning off incoming telnet, incoming rlogin, and incoming FTP. Everything else was allowed through, hence the name \"Default Permit.\" This put the security practitioner in an endless arms-race with the hackers. Suppose a new vulnerability is found in a service that is not blocked - now the administrators need to decide whether to deny it or not, hopefully, before they got hacked. A lot of organizations adopted \"Default Permit\" in the early 1990's and convinced themselves it was OK because \"hackers will never bother to come after us.\" The 1990's, with the advent of worms, should have killed off \"Default Permit\" forever but it didn't. In fact, most networks today are still built around the notion of an open core with no segmentation. That's \"Default Permit.\"</p> <p>Another place where \"Default Permit\" crops up is in how we typically approach code execution on our systems. The default is to permit anything on your machine to execute if you click on it, unless its execution is denied by something like an antivirus program or a spyware blocker. If you think about that for a few seconds, you'll realize what a dumb idea that is. On my computer here I run about 15 different applications on a regular basis. There are probably another 20 or 30 installed that I use every couple of months or so. I still don't understand why operating systems are so dumb that they let any old virus or piece of spyware execute without even asking me. That's \"Default Permit.\"</p> <p>A few years ago I worked on analyzing a website's security posture as part of an E-banking security project. The website had a load-balancer in front of it, that was capable of re-vectoring traffic by URL, and my client wanted to use the load-balancer to deflect worms and hackers by re-vectoring attacks to a black hole address. Re-vectoring attacks would have meant adopting a policy of \"Default Permit\" (i.e.: if it's not a known attack, let it through) but instead I talked them into adopting the opposite approach. The load-balancer was configured to re-vector any traffic not matching a complete list of correctly-structured URLs to a server that serves up image data and 404 pages, which is running a special locked-down configuration. Not surprisingly, that site has withstood the test of time quite well.</p> <p>One clear symptom that you've got a case of \"Default Permit\" is when you find yourself in an arms race with the hackers. It means that you've put yourself in a situation where what you don't know can hurt you, and you'll be doomed to playing keep ahead/catch-up.</p> <p>The opposite of \"Default Permit\" is \"Default Deny\" and it is a really good idea. It takes dedication, thought, and understanding to implement a \"Default Deny\" policy, which is why it is so seldom done. It's not that much harder to do than \"Default Permit\" but you'll sleep much better at night.</p>"},{"location":"societal/six-dumb-ideas/#enumerating-badness","title":"Enumerating Badness","text":"<p>Back in the early days of computer security, there were only a relatively small number of well-known security holes. That had a lot to do with the widespread adoption of \"Default Permit\" because, when there were only 15 well-known ways to hack into a network, it was possible to individually examine and think about those 15 attack vectors and block them. So security practitioners got into the habit of \"Enumerating Badness\" - listing all the bad things that we know about. Once you list all the badness, then you can put things in place to detect it, or block it.</p> Figure 1: The \"Badness Gap\" <p>Why is \"Enumerating Badness\" a dumb idea? It's a dumb idea because sometime around 1992 the amount of Badness in the Internet began to vastly outweigh the amount of Goodness. For every harmless, legitimate, application, there are dozens or hundreds of pieces of malware, worm tests, exploits, or viral code. Examine a typical antivirus package and you'll see it knows about 75,000+ viruses that might infect your machine. Compare that to the legitimate 30 or so apps that I've installed on my machine, and you can see it's rather dumb to try to track 75,000 pieces of Badness when even a simpleton could track 30 pieces of Goodness. In fact, if I were to simply track the 30 pieces of Goodness on my machine, and allow nothing else to run, I would have simultaneously solved the following problems:</p> <ul> <li>Spyware</li> <li>Viruses</li> <li>Remote Control Trojans</li> <li>Exploits that involve executing pre-installed code that you don't use regularly</li> </ul> <p>Thanks to all the marketing hype around disclosing and announcing vulnerabilities, there are (according to some industry analysts) between 200 and 700 new pieces of Badness hitting the Internet every month. Not only is \"Enumerating Badness\" a dumb idea, it's gotten dumber during the few minutes of your time you've bequeathed me by reading this article.</p> <p>Now, your typical IT executive, when I discuss this concept with him or her, will stand up and say something like, \"That sounds great, but our enterprise network is really complicated. Knowing about all the different apps that we rely on would be impossible! What you're saying sounds reasonable until you think about it and realize how absurd it is!\" To which I respond, \"How can you call yourself a 'Chief Technology Officer' if you have no idea what your technology is doing?\" A CTO isn't going to know detail about every application on the network, but if you haven't got a vague idea what's going on it's impossible to do capacity planning, disaster planning, security planning, or virtually any of the things in a CTO's charter.</p> <p>In 1994 I wrote a firewall product that needed some system log analysis routines that would alert the administrator in case some kind of unexpected condition was detected. The first version used \"Enumerating Badness\" (I've been dumb, too) but the second version used what I termed \" Artificial Ignorance\" - a process whereby you throw away the log entries you know aren't interesting. If there's anything left after you've thrown away the stuff you know isn't interesting, then the leftovers must be interesting. This approach worked amazingly well, and detected a number of very interesting operational conditions and errors that it simply never would have occurred to me to look for.</p> <p>\"Enumerating Badness\" is the idea behind a huge number of security products and systems, from anti-virus to intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, application security, and \"deep packet inspection\" firewalls. What these programs and devices do is outsource your process of knowing what's good. Instead of you taking the time to list the 30 or so legitimate things you need to do, it's easier to pay $29.95/year to someone else who will try to maintain an exhaustive list of all the evil in the world. Except, unfortunately, your badness expert will get $29.95/year for the antivirus list, another $29.95/year for the spyware list, and you'll buy a $19.95 \"personal firewall\" that has application control for network applications. By the time you're done paying other people to enumerate all the malware your system could come in contact with, you'll more than double the cost of your \"inexpensive\" desktop operating system.</p> <p>One clear symptom that you have a case of \"Enumerating Badness\" is that you've got a system or software that needs signature updates on a regular basis, or a system that lets past a new worm that it hasn't seen before. The cure for \"Enumerating Badness\" is, of course, \"Enumerating Goodness.\" Amazingly, there is virtually no support in operating systems for such software-level controls. I've tried using Windows XP Pro's Program Execution Control but it's oriented toward \"Enumerating Badness\" and is, itself a dumb implementation of a dumb idea.</p> <p>In a sense, \"Enumerating Badness\" is a special dumb-case of \"Default Permit\" - our #1 dumb computer security idea. But it's so prevalent that it's in a class by itself.</p>"},{"location":"societal/six-dumb-ideas/#penetrate-and-patch","title":"Penetrate and Patch","text":"<p>There's an old saying, \"You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\" It's pretty much true, unless you wind up using so much silk to patch the sow's ear that eventually the sow's ear is completely replaced with silk. Unfortunately, when buggy software is fixed it is almost always fixed through the addition of new code, rather than the removal of old bits of sow's ear.</p> <p>\"Penetrate and Patch\" is a dumb idea best expressed in the BASIC programming language:</p> <pre><code>10 GOSUB LOOK_FOR_HOLES\n20 IF HOLE_FOUND = FALSE THEN GOTO 50\n30 GOSUB FIX_HOLE\n40 GOTO 10\n50 GOSUB CONGRATULATE_SELF\n60 GOSUB GET_HACKED_EVENTUALLY_ANYWAY\n70 GOTO 10 \n</code></pre> <p>In other words, you attack your firewall/software/website/whatever from the outside, identify a flaw in it, fix the flaw, and then go back to looking. One of my programmer buddies refers to this process as \"turd polishing\" because, as he says, it doesn't make your code any less smelly in the long run but management might enjoy its improved, shiny, appearance in the short term. In other words, the problem with \"Penetrate and Patch\" is not that it makes your code/implementation/system better by design, rather it merely makes it toughened by trial and error. Richard Feynman's \" Personal Observations on the Reliability of the Space Shuttle\" used to be required reading for the software engineers that I hired. It contains some profound thoughts on expectation of reliability and how it is achieved in complex systems. In a nutshell its meaning to programmers is: \"Unless your system was supposed to be hackable then it shouldn't be hackable.\"</p> <p>\"Penetrate and Patch\" crops up all over the place, and is the primary dumb idea behind the current fad (which has been going on for about 10 years) of vulnerability disclosure and patch updates. The premise of the \"vulnerability researchers\" is that they are helping the community by finding holes in software and getting them fixed before the hackers find them and exploit them. The premise of the vendors is that they are doing the right thing by pushing out patches to fix the bugs before the hackers and worm-writers can act upon them. Both parties, in this scenario, are being dumb because if the vendors were writing code that had been designed to be secure and reliable then vulnerability discovery would be a tedious and unrewarding game, indeed!</p> <p>Let me put it to you in different terms: if \"Penetrate and Patch\" was effective, we would have run out of security bugs in Internet Explorer by now. What has it been? 2 or 3 a month for 10 years? If you look at major internet applications you'll find that there are a number that consistently have problems with security vulnerabilities. There are also a handful, like PostFix, Qmail, etc, that were engineered to be compartmented against themselves, with modularized permissions and processing, and - not surprisingly - they have histories of amazingly few bugs. The same logic applies to \"penetration testing.\" There are networks that I know of which have been \"penetration tested\" any number of times and are continually getting hacked to pieces. That's because their design (or their security practices) are so fundamentally flawed that no amount of turd polish is going to keep the hackers out. It just keeps managers and auditors off of the network administrator's backs. I know other networks that it is, literally, pointless to \"penetration test\" because they were designed from the ground up to be permeable only in certain directions and only to certain traffic destined to carefully configured servers running carefully secured software. Running a \"penetration test\" for Apache bugs is completely pointless against a server that is running a custom piece of C code that is running in a locked-down portion of an embedded system. So, \"Penetrate and Patch\" is pointless either because you know you're going to find an endless litany of bugs, or because you know you're not going to find anything comprehensible. Pointless is dumb.</p> <p>One clear symptom that you've got a case of \"Penetrate and Patch \" is when you find that your system is always vulnerable to the \"bug of the week.\" It means that you've put yourself in a situation where every time the hackers invent a new weapon, it works against you. Doesn't that sound dumb? Your software and systems should be secure by design and should have been designed with flaw-handling in mind.</p>"},{"location":"societal/six-dumb-ideas/#hacking-is-cool","title":"Hacking is Cool","text":"<p>One of the best ways to get rid of cockroaches in your kitchen is to scatter bread-crumbs under the stove, right? Wrong! That's a dumb idea. One of the best ways to discourage hacking on the Internet is to give the hackers stock options, buy the books they write about their exploits, take classes on \"extreme hacking kung fu\" and pay them tens of thousands of dollars to do \"penetration tests\" against your systems, right? Wrong! \"Hacking is Cool\" is a really dumb idea.</p> <p>Around the time I was learning to walk, Donn Parker was researching the behavioral aspects of hacking and computer security. He says it better than I ever could:</p> <p>\"Remote computing freed criminals from the historic requirement of proximity to their crimes. Anonymity and freedom from personal victim confrontation increased the emotional ease of crime, i.e., the victim was only an inanimate computer, not a real person or enterprise. Timid people could become criminals. The proliferation of identical systems and means of use and the automation of business made possible and improved the economics of automating crimes and constructing powerful criminal tools and scripts with great leverage.\"</p> <p>Hidden in Parker's observation is the awareness that hacking is a social problem. It's not a technology problem, at all. \"Timid people could become criminals.\" The Internet has given a whole new form of elbow-room to the badly socialized borderline personality. The #4th dumbest thing information security practitioners can do is implicitly encourage hackers by lionizing them. The media plays directly into this, by portraying hackers, variously, as \"whiz kids\" and \"brilliant technologists\" - of course if you're a reporter for CNN, anyone who can install Linux probably does qualify as a \"brilliant technologist\" to you. I find it interesting to compare societal reactions to hackers as \"whiz kids\" versus spammers as \"sleazy con artists.\" I'm actually heartened to see that the spammers, phishers, and other scammers are adopting the hackers and the techniques of the hackers - this will do more to reverse society's view of hacking than any other thing we could do.</p> <p>If you're a security practitioner, teaching yourself how to hack is also part of the \"Hacking is Cool\" dumb idea. Think about it for a couple of minutes: teaching yourself a bunch of exploits and how to use them means you're investing your time in learning a bunch of tools and techniques that are going to go stale as soon as everyone has patched that particular hole. It means you've made part of your professional skill-set dependent on \"Penetrate and Patch\" and you're going to have to be part of the arms-race if you want that skill-set to remain relevant and up-to-date. Wouldn't it be more sensible to learn how to design security systems that are hack-proof than to learn how to identify security systems that are dumb?</p> <p>My prediction is that the \"Hacking is Cool\" dumb idea will be a dead idea in the next 10 years.

On the surface of things, the idea of \"Educating Users\" seems less than dumb: education is always good. On the other hand, like \"Penetrate and Patch\" if it was going to work, it would have worked by now. There have been numerous interesting studies that indicate that a significant percentage of users will trade their password for a candy bar, and the Anna Kournikova worm showed us that nearly 1/2 of humanity will click on anything purporting to contain nude pictures of semi-famous females. If \"Educating Users\" is the strategy you plan to embark upon, you should expect to have to \"patch\" your users every week. That's dumb.</p> <p>The real question to ask is not \"can we educate our users to be better at security?\" it is \"why do we need to educate our users at all?\" In a sense, this is another special case of \"Default Permit\" - why are users getting executable attachments at all? Why are users expecting to get E-mails from banks where they don't have accounts? Most of the problems that are addressable through user education are self-correcting over time. As a younger generation of workers moves into the workforce, they will come pre-installed with a healthy skepticism about phishing and social engineering.</p> <p>Dealing with things like attachments and phishing is another case of \"Default Permit\" - our favorite dumb idea. After all, if you're letting all of your users get attachments in their E-mail you're \"Default Permit\"ing anything that gets sent to them. A better idea might be to simply quarantine all attachments as they come into the enterprise, delete all the executables outright, and store the few file types you decide are acceptable on a staging server where users can log in with an SSL-enabled browser (requiring a password will quash a lot of worm propagation mechanisms right away) and pull them down. There are freeware tools like MIMEDefang that can be easily harnessed to strip attachments from incoming E-mails, write them to a per-user directory, and replace the attachment in the E-mail message with a URL to the stripped attachment. Why educate your users how to cope with a problem if you can just drive a stake through the problem's heart?</p> <p>When I was CEO of a small computer security start-up we didn't have a Windows system administrator. All of the employees who wanted to run Windows had to know how to install it and manage it themselves, or they didn't get hired in the first place.

What an utterly brilliant strategy!</p> <p>There's an important corollary to the \"Action is Better Than Inaction\" dumb idea, and it's that:</p> <p>\"It is often easier to not do something dumb than it is to do something smart.\"  </p> <p>Sun Tzu didn't really write that in \"The Art of War\" but if you tell IT executives that he did, they'll take you much more seriously when you counsel a judicious, thoughtful approach to fielding some new whizzbang. To many of my clients, I have been counselling, \"hold off on outsourcing your security for a year or two and then get recommendations and opinions from the bloody, battered survivors - if there are any.\"</p> <p>You can see the \"Action is Better Than Inaction\" dumb idea all over corporate networks and it tends to correlate with senior IT managers that make their product-purchasing decisions by reading Gartner research reports and product glossies from vendors. If you find yourself in the chain of command of such a manager, I sincerely hope you've enjoyed this article because you're probably far better acquainted with dumbness than I am.</p> <p>One extremely useful piece of management kung-fu to remember, if you find yourself up against an \"early adopter\" is to rely on your peers. Several years ago I had a client who was preparing to spend a ton of money on a technology without testing it operationally. I suggested offhandedly to the senior IT manager in charge that he should send one of his team to a relevant conference (in this case,  LISA) where it was likely that someone with hands-on experience with the technology would be in attendance. I proposed that the manager have his employee put a message on the \"meet and greet\" bulletin board that read:</p> <p>\"Do you have hands-on experience with xyz from pdq.com? If so, I'm authorized to take you to dinner at Ruth's Chris if you promise to give me the low-down on the product off the record. Contact, etc...\" </p> <p>The IT manager later told me that a $200 dinner expense saved them over $400,000 worth of hellish technological trauma.</p> <p>It really is easier to not do something dumb than it is to do something smart. The trick is, when you avoid doing something dumb, to make sure your superiors know you navigated around a particularly nasty sand-bar and that you get appropriate credit for being smart. Isn't that the ultimate expression of professional kung-fu? To get credit for not doing anything?!</p>"},{"location":"societal/six-dumb-ideas/#the-minor-dumbs","title":"The Minor Dumbs","text":"<p>These dumb ideas didn't quite merit status as \"The Dumbest\" ideas in computer security, but they're pretty dumb and deserve mention in passing:</p> <ul> <li>\"We're Not a Target\" - yes, you are.

In order to achieve secure software, developers must be supported and helped by the organization they author code for.

All tiers of a web application, the user interface, the business logic, the controller, the database code and more  all need to be developed with security in mind. This can be a very difficult task and developers are often set up for failure. Most developers did not learn about secure coding or crypto in school. The languages and frameworks that developers use to build web applications are often lacking critical core controls or are insecure by default in some way. It is also very rare when organizations provide developers with prescriptive requirements that guide them down the path of secure software.

One of its key goals is to give organizations a way to prevent and detect tampering of the sort that happened at SolarWinds, where an adversary inserted malicious code into \u2014 and distributed it via \u2014 a signed software update.</p> <p>SLSA is a prescriptive checklist, meaning it spells out the steps that organizations need to take. That includes, for instance, verifying the provenance of all open source and third-party components in their software, and for ensuring there's been no tampering with the software.\u00a0</p> <p>Among other things, it also requires that organizations retain source code indefinitely and have the ability to verify the integrity of their software with tamper-proof provenance information.</p> <p>Google perceives the SLSA framework as allowing organizations to optimize the benefits of things like a  software bill of materials (SBOMs), i.e.,\u00a0a list of all the components in a particular piece of software.</p>"},{"location":"software/slsa/#assuming-more-responsibility","title":"Assuming More Responsibility","text":"<p>One of the other keys to bolstering supply chain security at an industry level is for organizations to secure their own open source and proprietary software supply chains, Google said.</p> <p>This means ensuring that all software they build or acquire from other sources implements baseline security standards and controls. As an example, Google pointed to the Minimum Viable Secure Product (MVSP) requirements for enterprise-ready software that it developed in collaboration with several other companies, including Okta, Salesforce, Slack, and Venafi.</p> <p>MVSP is a  checklist of baseline security controls that a software developer must implement, at a minimum, to ensure a reasonably secure product. The checklist includes things such as whether the software vendor or publisher publishes vulnerability reports, conducts self-assessments and external testing, and implements practices such as SSO, HTTPS, and security headers.</p> <p>Software purchasers can use the baseline to assess whether a product meets those requirements, while larger companies can incorporate MVSP as their standard questionnaire when triaging the security posture of their third-party software suppliers, Google said. Procurement teams can include them in requests for proposal (RFP) documents and use it as security baseline for vendor selection, Google said.</p> <p>Hansen says security leaders and practitioners can also take other measures to bolster software supply chain security. \"Findings from the report suggest a need for a more thorough understanding of software supply chain networks, identification of potential risks and implementation of risk-mitigation plans, and the establishment of security requirements for software procurement,\" he notes.</p> <p>Security organizations can play a role as well by, for example, funding the Open Source Security Foundation (OSSF) and the open source software project maintainers who find and fix security vulnerability in open source code, Hansen says. </p>"},{"location":"system/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The system security knowledge area focuses on the security aspects of systems composed of components and connections, and the use of software.

Below are 10 things an auditor needs to know about cyber security. This list is not all-encompassing, nor is it ranked in any order.</p> <ol> <li>Everything is connected to everything. The primary function and objective of any cyber device is connectivity. Devices are like climbers roped together on the side of a mountain \u2013 if one falls, it can bring down anything connected to it. The Target hack (through an HVAC supplier connection) clearly demonstrates the need for a holistic cyber security view. With the arrival of the Internet of Things, it\u2019s imperative that auditors understand and address the bigger picture.</li> <li>All risks are subjective. To qualify as a \u201crisk,\u201d a threat needs to be associated with a vulnerability that \u2013 if exploited \u2013 could negatively impact an information asset. If it does not, it is not a threat. Too many auditors worry about threats and vulnerabilities that pose no actual risk to an asset, prioritizing compliance over risk and wasting precious time and resources.</li> <li>Users are (and will always be) the biggest security risk. Our industry is led by vendors, and we continue to seek security through products (firewalls, IDS/IPS, DLP, etc.). We invest in product before people while real and measurable results can be achieved by investing in information security awareness. To contribute tangible results, auditors should prioritize people over product. Cyber security education is the silver bullet.</li> <li>Leverage existing frameworks/guidelines. Auditors should consider mapping of the NIST \u201cFramework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity\u201d to ISO 27001:2013 controls and COBIT 5 to reduce the scope of the audit, making the audit more manageable.</li> <li>Consider forthcoming legislation. Auditors should study how forthcoming and existing legislation like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) could potentially be incorporated into cyber security programs. Also, auditors need to understand the global regulatory environment and the differences that can exist between different geographic regions.</li> <li>** Basic information security controls still hold true.** As part of overall security (including cyber security), these controls provide a valid baseline of security controls that help create in-depth security, such as physical and logical access controls and application of \u201cprinciple of least privilege.\u201d</li> <li>Utilize a cyber incident response policy and plan that is fully tested. Auditors need to assess whether a proper crisis management and communication plan is in place, clearly communicated and tested as appropriate. This should enable sufficient business continuity in the event of a cyber security breach. Crisis management should include incident response and forensics, where warranted. Proactive monitoring and detection (with automated tools) should be in place.</li> <li>Cyber security strategy needs to be agile \u2013 the landscape is \u201cmutating.\u201d Strategy needs to be adaptable and scalable to handle new attack methods, such as ransomware and cloud-related risks. Auditors need to be aware that this is an area that is constantly changing and must not assume that what currently keeps your IT environment secure will continue to remain secure indefinitely.</li> <li>Cyber security awareness depends on the right training. Employees need sufficient and timely education and training to help combat ever-changing cyber security threat. Security needs to be interwoven into the fabric on an organization.  One-off, box-checking exercises are not sufficient. For example:<ul> <li>Do employees understand the implications of a cyber security breach?</li> <li>Has any thought been given to insider threats from a cyber security perspective?</li> <li>Is there clear guidance on the use of social media/shadow IT solutions/BYOD/how to respond to a phishing or ransomware attack?</li> <li>Are employees rewarded/praised for promoting security in an organization? Are they incentivized?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Be aware of credential theft techniques. Auditors should have knowledge of credential theft attack techniques. Typically, the Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack and other credential theft attacks utilize an iterative, two-stage process. First, an attacker captures account logon credentials on one computer, and then uses those captured credentials to authenticate to other computers over the network.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"system/cis-controls/","title":"CIS Controls","text":"<p>Outdated material</p> <p>The information and links listed below are for the older version 7.

The attackers are using methods which are specifically aimed at exploiting potential weak spots in the web application software itself \u2013 and this is why they are not detected, or are not detected with sufficient accuracy, by traditional IT security systems such as network firewalls or IDS/IPS systems. OWASP develops tools and best practices to support developers, project managers and security testers in the development and operation of secure web applications.

As illustrated by the graph below, a web application to which there is no access can only be protected sensibly by a WAF (additional benefit of the WAF).
